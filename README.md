# Dungeon Crawlers
## Description:
Dungeon Crawlers is a cpp file that has no purpose other than to entertain the user with a short, text based adventure. This project was created as a final for our introduction to programming class at Southwest Technology College. The way it works is by a decision making system much like one of those phone services. Like press 1 to continue, press 2 to send cash. Here's an example from our code:

## How To:
Since this project is only a CPP file, all you need is a compiler such as [this](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler) online compiler. After choosing your compiler, copy-pasting the code works just fine or, alternatively, just opening it. Once it is open, just compile and open up the console. It's recommended to have at least a 10 line tall console screen open in order to see most text without having to scroll. Once the program is running, you will be prompted to either enter in an enter key itself or, as indicated by the ">" symbol, a number that coincides with the action displayed on screen. Like this:
