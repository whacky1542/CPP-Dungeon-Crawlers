Ralf -
Hello adventurer! Welcome to the town Narnia! My name is Ralf and I’ll be your guide to DUNGEON CRAWLERS. Your goal is to gain wealth and fame by delving the endless amount of dungeons just on the edge of town. It won’t be easy to do it by your lonesome, so go over to the Blacksmith for weapons and armor or the Alchemist for potions. When you are ready to delve your first dungeon, just give the word.

2 - Go to the Blacksmith (Brings user to Blacksmith dialogue)
3 - Go to the Alchemist (Brings user to Alchemist dialogue)
4 - Check Inventory (Brings user to Inventory dialogue)
5 - Quit (Brings user to gameStart())
